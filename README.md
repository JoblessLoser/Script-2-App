# Script-2-App
A simple Script which will turn any script into a MacOS Application (with an icon that can be launched from the Dock)

Running the script will

Request a target script to turn into an Application 
Ask a number of questions to fill in the Application Bundles properties 
Ask for an image file to turn in to an icon (1024x1024 would be ideal but tje script will attempt to create an icon from any image size).
Create a new Application Bundel in your ~/Applications folder
Open the ~/Applications folder

Applications are not signed code so may not function correctly if copied to other computers without fixing the extension attributes

I wish I had made this script sooner

Have Fun!
